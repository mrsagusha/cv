<span class="aboutme-span">In short:</span> I have been programming for about a year. During my studies I was in the top 100 best
students of the course. Main stack: React, MobX, Typecript (I would like to study Angular in the 
future, because it's closely related to the usege of the TypeScript and is also a full-fledged 
framework).<br><br>
<span class="aboutme-span">Experiance:</span> As a real development experience, I can single out participation in the 
development of a website for a Georgian construction company and the development of pet projects.<br><br> 
<span class="aboutme-span">Soft Skills:</span> Sociable and the ability to find a compromise (experience in logistics affects), 
the desire for education and professional growth, perseverance, time management, and how banal it
would not sound stress resistance.<br><br>
<span class="aboutme-span">Goals:</span> Successfully complete the training and get an 
internship.<br><br> 
<span class="aboutme-span">About me:</span> At the moment I work in the logistics sphere as a leading freight forwarder. 
Polish is actively used in work, less often English. I started studying programming because I 
almost reached the ceiling of development in my sphere, and here I think there is 
unlimited potential for development. Among my hobbies I can mention drawing portraits 
(I am studying), in my free time I play football with friends.</p>`;
